Hello and welcome to my GitHub page! My name is Leonardo Moura, I am an Android engineer with over 6 years of experience working on both indie projects and helping small companies bring their ideas to life through high-performance and user-friendly mobile applications that push the boundaries of what's visually possible. Through my extensive experience managing all aspects of mobile application development, including design, programming, testing, and launch, I bring a unique perspective to the table that can help increase creativity and innovation on any team.

In addition to my technical skills, I have also 5 years of experience as a Senior Graphic Designer, honing my skills in visual design, typography, and branding. This combination of technical and creative expertise allows me to not only develop functional applications but also ensure they have a polished and engaging user interface.
