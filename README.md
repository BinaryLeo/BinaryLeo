Hello and welcome to my GitHub page! My name is Leonardo Moura, and I am a Brazilian mobile developer with over six years of experience building both user-friendly and complex applications as an independent developer for small companies. Here, you can find my latest open-source projects. Keep in touch for more exciting updates! Currently, I am expanding my skill set by learning Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

I am proud to have won two mobile development contests and to have published over six applications on the Play Store as an independent developer. Additionally, I have delivered numerous successful UI/UX designs for global clients.
